# Overview
## Objectives
1. Create and customize plots using Matplotlib
2. Conduct quantitative comparisons to produce statistical visualizations
3. Create time-series plots


## Skill Development
* **Data Science Principles:** time-series data
* **Coding:** working with libraries
* **Data Visualization:** plotting data with Matplotlib
* **Professional:** sharing visualizations


# Deliverables
## 1. DataCamp Assignments
* Complete the assigned **DataCamp Module** by logging in to *DataCamp > Organizations > My Assignments*:
    * [Introduction to Data Visualization in Matplotlib](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-matplotlib)
        * Introduction to Matplotlib
        * Plotting time-series
        * Quantitative comparisons and statistical visualizations
        * Sharing visualizations with others

## 2. Case Study: 

* Pull and complete the [Case Study notebook](link.com) starter code & your assigned dataset from the [data folder](link.com) (both contained in this repository--see above) 
    * For each exercise in the case study, write and run the appropriate code to find the answer.
    * Save and commit your finished assignment back to the master branch. 

## 3. Prepare for Lab Session (Thurs.)
* Given the link provided in class, in small groups: 
    * Review the read me file and exploratory data analysis code of your peers
    * Provide substantive feedback
