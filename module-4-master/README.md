# Overview
## Objectives
1. Create and visualize DataFrames with pandas
2. Understand joins
3. Manipulate DataFrames: transform, aggregate, slice, index, and merge


## Skill Development
* **Data Science Principles:** supplementing/joining datasets
* **Coding:** working with DataFrames
* **Data Visualization:** visualizations with pandas
* **Professional:** developing/presenting advanced research questions


# Deliverables
## 1. DataCamp Assignments
* Complete the assigned **DataCamp Modules** by logging in to *DataCamp > Organizations > My Assignments*:
    * [Data Manipulation with pandas](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas)
        * Transforming DataFrames
        * Aggregating DataFrames
        * Slicing and indexing DataFrames
        * Creating and visualizing DataFrames
    * [Joining Data with pandas](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-pandas)
        * Join types
        * Merging and concatenating data
        * Considerations for ordered and time-series data merging

## 2. Case Studies: Feed Grain Sector | Estimated Income by Location

* Pull and complete the **Case Study notebooks (2)** starter code & your assigned dataset from the **data folder** (both contained in this repository--see above) 
    * For each exercise in the case studies, write and run the appropriate code to find the answer.
    * Save and commit your finished assignments back to the master branch. 

## 3. Prepare for Lab Session (Thurs.)
With consideration to feedback provided in prior weeks: 
* Select a (1) dataset of interest (***It does not have to be one previously used or reviewed***)
* Find a complementary/supplementary dataset
* Develop a research question integrating the datasets
* Use **both** datasets to create a GitHub repository that includes: 
    * An overview of the datasets
    * The proposed research question
    * A preliminary exploration of the data, including the relationship between datasets and plots where needed. 
* ***Be prepared to introduce/share the repository in small groups during the lab session.***
