# Overview
## Objectives
1. Identify appropriate use for and construct data structures
2. Create and execute functions
3. Apply logic, control flow, filtering, and loops to code
4. Manipulate and visualize data with Matplotlib and Pandas


## Skill Development
* **Data Science Principles:** analyzing DataFrames
* **Coding:** functions, loops, and error handling
* **Data Visualization:** customizing plots with Matplotlib
* **Professional:** finding, summarizing, and presenting data


# Deliverables
## 1. DataCamp Assignments
* Complete the assigned **DataCamp Modules** by logging in to *DataCamp > Organizations > My Assignments*:
    * [Intermediate Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python)
        * Matplotlib
        * Dictionaries and Pandas
        * Boolean logic for filtering
        * Loops
    * [Python for Data Science Toolbox 1](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1)
        * Writing functions
        * Default arguments, variable-length arguments, and scope
        * Lambda functions and error handling

## 2. Case Studies: Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
* Pull and complete the **Case Study notebooks (2)** starter code & your assigned dataset from the **data folder** (both contained in this repository--see above) 
    * For each exercise in the case studies, write and run the appropriate code to find the answer.
    * Save and commit your finished assignments back to the master branch. 

## 3. Prepare for Lab Session (Thurs.)
* Find 3 datasets of interest
* Create a GitHub repository that includes: 
    * **An overview of each dataset** including summary statistics and plots, where applicable
    * **Potential research questions** that could be explored using each dataset and broad steps required to perform the analysis
* ***Be prepared to introduce/share the datasets in small groups during the lab session.***
