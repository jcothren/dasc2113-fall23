# Overview
## Objectives
1. Exploring data: tidying, combining, and cleaning data for analysis
2. Distinguish between independent and dependent relationships of variables
3. Inspect data through distribution plots



## Skill Development
* **Data Science Principles:** multivariate thinking
* **Coding:** data handling in python
* **Data Visualization:** visualizing variable relationships with plots
* **Professional:** team-based data analysis


# Deliverables
## 1. DataCamp Assignments
* Complete the assigned **DataCamp Module** by logging in to *DataCamp > Organizations > My Assignments*:
    * [Exploratory Data Analysis in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-python)
        * Read, clean, and validate
        * Distributions
        * Relationships
        * Multivariate thinking


## 2. Case Study: 

* Pull and complete the [Case Study notebook](link.com) starter code & your assigned dataset from the [data folder](link.com) (both contained in this repository--see above) 
    * For each exercise in the case study, write and run the appropriate code to find the answer.
    * Save and commit your finished assignment back to the master branch. 

## 3. Prepare for Lab Session (Thurs.)
* With consideration to prior feedback, in small groups: 
    * Select data and a research question
    * Use python to conduct an exploratory data analysis using techniques and plots appropriate for the data selected
    * Create a GitHub repository including the code used and a read me file introducing the data and findings
